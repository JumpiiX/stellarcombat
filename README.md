# StellarCombat

**StellarCombat** is a personal project embarked upon as an introductory journey into C++ development, with a keen focus on exploring game mathematics such as coordinate systems and vector operations. This simple yet engaging 2D spacewar game serves not only as a means to dive into the realms of game development but also as a practical application of mathematical concepts in programming. Through **StellarCombat**, I aim to deepen my understanding of C++ while unraveling the fascinating world of mathematics in game programming.

## Core Objectives

- **Learning C++ Fundamentals**: Gaining a solid grasp of C++ syntax and core principles through a gaming project.
- **Exploring Game Mathematics**: Delving into coordinate systems, vectors, and their utilization in game development for movement dynamics, collision detection, and more.
- **Game Loop and Rendering Mechanics**: Implementing a basic game loop and rendering game objects on the screen, understanding the flow and structure of game execution.


## Getting Started

To get started with **StellarCombat**, clone this repository to your local machine. Detailed instructions for compiling and running the game will be provided as the project develops.
